    <p>
      I’m a software developer with experience building reliable, user-focused applications, with a strong emphasis on performance, accessibility, and clean, maintainable architecture. I work comfortably across the stack and take ownership of features from initial design through to implementation and delivery.
    </p>
    <p>
      I value pragmatic engineering, clear communication, and continuous improvement, and I enjoy applying these principles to build systems that are robust, scalable, and easy to maintain.
